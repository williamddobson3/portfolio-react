About Actual Website & Contact Page

BeReal does not provide a full web interface for its platform—interaction is app-only, so the visuals above reflect how the mobile app displays content.

A genuine “Contact Us” page exists in their Help Center:

Users are instructed to message via the app by navigating: Profile > “…” menu > Help > Contact Us.

The publicly listed contact email is: contact@bere.al for help or feedback.
