What You’re Seeing:

Image 1 (turn0image0): Early promotional UI showcasing a smartphone interface and app title—likely from a blog or press release.

Image 2 & 3 (turn0image2, turn0image3): Scans from Fast Company, illustrating in-app screens like messaging timelines and UI layout—these are not web pages but app visuals.

Why Official Website Screenshots Aren’t Available:

Pair/Couple functioned solely as a mobile app, lacking a publicly accessible web portal.

The company did not publish static "Contact Us" or home screens on the web.

Most existing visuals come from older archival or media articles, not the app itself.

Alternatives for Your Portfolio or Presentation:

If you’d like to include visuals that reflect Pair’s design style or user experience, I can help with:

High-fidelity mockups of a homepage, contact/support page, or app screen in Pair’s aesthetic—ideal for portfolio context.

Feature breakdowns with UI components based on known app functionality and interface style.

Visualization of key app flows like “thumbkissing,” shared timelines, or sketches-to-your-partner interactions.
