Why Web Page Screenshots Aren’t Available

Path had no publicly accessible website for user interaction. It was designed as a mobile-first service with little to no web-based UI for end users.

The service has been shut down since 2018, so no pages are currently live.

Any official contact functionality existed only inside the app, not through a standalone “Contact Us” webpage.

Options for Your Portfolio or Presentation

Although live pages aren’t available, you still have strong options to visually represent Path:

Mockup Recreation
I can help design high-fidelity mockups of a conceptual Path homepage, a contact/settings screen, or another interface screen—styled based on the app’s known design patterns and aesthetic.

Feature and Design Breakdown
I can describe how Path structured its UI, UX flows, componentry, and emotional design—then help you apply or adapt that in your own portfolio projects or case studies.
