About Pixelfed Home Interface

Pixelfed's homepage closely resembles Instagram's clean, content-first layout but operates within the Fediverse, meaning it’s decentralized and privacy-focused. Here's what’s notable:

Chronological feed — no algorithmic sorting, providing a genuine and chronological browsing experience 


Clean, image-forward UI — minimal distractions, emphasizing visual content and intuitive navigation.

Privacy-friendly features — direct from open-source philosophy, with options like follower-only visibility, unlisted posts, and no tracking
