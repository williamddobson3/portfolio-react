How We Can Proceed

You have two solid options depending on your needs:

Option 1: Capture Screenshots Yourself

You can manually visit the following pages and take screenshots:

Homepage (e.g., smallbusinessbonfire.com)

Contact or About page (if available)

Any content-specific page, like an article or category listing

This will give you accurate visuals you can use directly.

Option 2: Create High-Fidelity Mockups

I can help you design polished mockups representing:

The Homepage

A Contact / Support page styled to fit the site’s aesthetics

An Article Listing page matching content layouts

Mockups are ideal if you're building a case study or portfolio showcase and want consistent, on-brand visuals.
