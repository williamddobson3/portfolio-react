Screenshot Breakdown

Landing Page (joinmastodon.org) – This modern homepage introduces Mastodon’s mission, federation model, and invites users to discover or join an instance. It’s part of Mastodon’s updated official website.

Web Interface (Mastodon v4.3.1) – A public-domain screenshot showing the Mastodon app’s multi-column or single-column UI for posts, timelines, and notifications within an instance.

Instance Directory / Server List View – A screenshot from Fast Company illustrating how users might browse or choose a Mastodon server (instance) to join from a directory or listing page.

Contact Page Details

Mastodon does not maintain a centralized “Contact Us” page, as the platform is federated and each instance operates independently.

For the official site (joinmastodon.org), contact instructions and details are included under their “About Us” or similar informational sections.

Meta-level communication (like project sponsorships) often goes through social posts or GitHub, with roles referenced on their blog or team pages; contributors sometimes reach out directly via Mastodon handles.

Regarding Ello and Diaspora

Ello: The platform has been inactive since July 2023, so no actual pages exist to screenshot.

Diaspora: Operates via independently hosted “pods,” so there's no centralized interface to capture. Thus, screenshots vary widely and aren’t standardized.
