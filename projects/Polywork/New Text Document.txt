Discussions in user forums indicate that the app may block screenshots under certain conditions, such as when “pro bots” or private sessions are displayed

What You Can Do Instead

If capturing actual site pages is essential for your work, here are a few actionable approaches:

Use the browser’s developer tools: Access Polywork’s cached or archived pages via services like the Wayback Machine, then capture screenshots manually.

Contact former users: Ask someone with an archived or static version of their profile to share screenshots.

Create polished mockups: I can help craft high-fidelity mockups of the Polywork homepage, contact preferences, and a badge/timeline interface styled in Polywork’s recognizable aesthetic. These are perfect for portfolio displays or case studies.
